# AI Coding Challenges

Think AI can't handle real programming challenges? 

Let's find out together.

I keep hearing that AI is great for trivial tasks but falls apart when you need actual software built. I'm skeptical of that claim.

I'm also skeptical of the hype.

So here's my challenge: if you believe AI can't solve a specific programming problem or build a particular type of software, share the problem with me. I'll attempt it using AI and document the process in a public repo on GitHub.

If AI can do the project, I'll show you how. If it cannot, we'll learn something valuable about where the boundaries actually are. This isn't about proving anyone wrong. It's about collaborative learning and documenting what's actually possible today.

The rules:

1. Well-specified and bounded. "Build the next Facebook" won't cut it. Give me a concrete, defined problem with clear scope.
2. Time-bound. I can dedicate a few hours, (maybe days if it's one that interests me) to each project, not months. For small-to-medium projects, that can mean building from scratch. For large codebases, it means fixing a specific bug or adding a well-defined feature.
3. Clear acceptance criteria. You define what "done" looks like upfront, so we all agree when or if it's solved.
4. Demonstrable. The result needs to be something I can share publicly so others can reproduce and verify the results.
5. No proprietary barriers. We need to be able to share the work so others can reproduce and verify the results.
6. Legal and ethical. Nothing that violates TOS, copyright, or involves malicious code.
7. You're available for questions. Well-specified tasks often have ambiguities that surface during implementation. I or the AI may need clarification as I work through it. 
8. Realistic performance expectations. If speed or efficiency matters, state your thresholds upfront.

Document your challenge in a public GitHub repo or public Google doc with all the details, then raise a PR on this repo adding your project to the list of challenges. 

Let's see what AI can actually do when put to the test.
